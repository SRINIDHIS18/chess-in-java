# chess-in-java
A Java chess engine calculates optimal moves using algorithms like minimax with alpha-beta pruning, evaluating positions by piece value, control, and possible moves. Often enhanced with machine learning or heuristics, it can be integrated with a GUI or used for standalone analysis and training.
